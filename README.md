# Social-Network-noSQL

## Description 

In this application, I have created a back-end social-media server using MongoDb and express. You can make request such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE using insomnia. The routes allow you to create users, add friends, add thoughts and add reactions to those thoughts.



## Installation

- npm install
- npm i mongoose
- npm express

## Usage 

Here is a demo video of how to use the API routes using insomnia!
